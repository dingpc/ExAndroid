1.ServiceµÄ¸ÅÄî
Q&A:A Service is an application component that runs in the background, 
	not interacting with the user, 
	for an indefinite period of time. 
	Each service class must have a corresponding <service> declaration in its package's AndroidManifest.xml. 
	Services can be started with Context.startService() and Context.bindService().
