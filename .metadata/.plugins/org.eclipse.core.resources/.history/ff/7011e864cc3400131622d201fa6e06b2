1.Activity的基本操作（启动、多个Activity互相启动、回调）
An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do. 
Almost all activities interact with the user, 
so the Activity class takes care of creating a window for you in which you can place your UI with setContentView(View). 
While activities are often presented to the user as full-screen windows, 
they can also be used in other ways: as floating windows (via a theme with windowIsFloating set) or embedded inside of another activity (using ActivityGroup). 
2.Intent的基本概念
An intent is an abstract description of an operation to be performed
3.startActivity和startActivityForResult的区别

startActivityForResult在启动了其他Activity之后是有回调的。
